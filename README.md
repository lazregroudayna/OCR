# OCR with EasyOCR
This project uses EasyOCR, a Python library, to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on images. OCR is the process of extracting text from images, such as scanned documents or photos.

# Features
      -Text Extraction from Images: Upload an image, and the OCR system will recognize and extract any text present in it.
      -Multi-Language Support: Currently supports text extraction in English, with the possibility to add more languages.
How to Use
# Step 1: Install EasyOCR
To get started, you need to install the easyocr library on your system. You can do this by following the installation instructions in the documentation.

# Step 2: Run OCR on an Image
Once EasyOCR is installed, you can use the system to read text from images. Simply upload an image to the program, and it will process the image to extract any visible text.

# Step 3: View Results
After running the OCR, the recognized text will be displayed. The extracted text will be shown clearly and without extra details like bounding boxes or confidence scores.

# Notes
      -This tool works best on clear, well-lit images with legible text.
      -You can change the language settings to recognize text in different languages, such as Arabic, by adjusting the settings accordingly.
